Some tools for fitting t-distributions to data.

# EM methods

These methods find the maximum likelihood parameters using the [expectation-maximization algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm). 
Since I am fitting these distributions primarily to calculate entropy I am using covergence of entropy as a stopping criteria for the EM algorithm (rather than the full likelihood) but it is easy to change this if it is not suitable for your purposes.

* `fitt` : fits a multivariate t-distribution using ECME algorithm [^1]
* `fitt_fixnu` : fits a t-distribution with d.o.f. (nu) specified.
* `fitt_commonnu` : fit t-distributions to grouped data, with d.o.f. (nu) common across groups
* `fitt_commonsnu` : fit t-distributions to grouped, with covariance (S) and d.o.f. (nu) common across groups

# Approximate methods

These use a closed form approximation the ML estimate which is faster to compute. However, they didn't work well for me - with the data I was using I sometimes got negative values for terms which should be non-negative (although it seemed to work OK with generated t-distributed samples). 

* `fitt_approx` : fits using the approximate method of Aeschliman et al. [^2]
